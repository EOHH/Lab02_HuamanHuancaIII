      <h1>Conclusions</h1>
      <ol>
        <li value="1">We managed to give content to the pages in each exercise, so that the layout and presentation of the content has a good interaction with visitors, this will also allow a better visualisation for visitors and good navigation.</li>
        <li>We managed to group the pages of the 5 exercises in a single page, from there you can navigate to the different pages and content.</li>
        <li>The javascript programming language was used to make our page interactive.</li>
        <li>The "var" tag was used to declare variables, this depends on how we want to set our variables, be it text or numeric.</li>
        <li>The tags "alert" and "document.write" were used to show the results of the exercises.</li>
        <li>We used CSS language to give design and responsiveness to our pages, we added page colour, text colour, text size, text position, among other functionalities.</li>
      </ol>
